            <p>
                Kevin Prachith is a 25-yr old aspiring Software Engineer. He is a graduate of the University of Georgia, having graduated in December 2017 with a Bachelors of Science in Biology. Originally having aspirations of becoming a pediatrician, he has since pivoted and is now fostering his long-held passion for everything technology, specifically diving deeper into the world of web development. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, he is a student in the fourth cohort of the Tech Transformation Academy (T2A) Web Development class, created in partnership between <a href="https://www.digitalcrafts.com/">DigitalCrafts</a> and <a href="https://cityofrefugeatl.org/">City of Refuge</a>. He is actively building his portfolio and tech stack to eventually bring his talents to a company in the tech industry. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In his free time, he enjoys reading, hiking, and exploring new ways to brew his morning coffee. He loves making puns and practicing his comedic muscles at every chance he gets. Chocolate is his vice, and he won't ever say no to eating at his favorite restaurant in the world, Cali n Titos (located in Athens, GA - ask for the steak cubano if you ever find yourself there).
